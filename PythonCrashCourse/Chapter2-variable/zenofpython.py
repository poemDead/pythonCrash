The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters

Beautiful is better than ugly.
美胜于丑
Explicit is better than implicit.
明确胜于按时
Simple is better than complex.
简单胜于复杂
Complex is better than complicated.
复杂胜于繁琐
Flat is better than nested.
扁平胜于嵌套
Sparse is better than dense.
少胜于多
Readability counts.
重视可读性
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
特殊情况也不足以打破规则
Although practicality beats purity.
尽管实用性胜于纯粹性
Errors should never pass silently.
但错误永远不该被忽视
Unless explicitly silenced.
除非我们是刻意选择静默
In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
面对含糊不清模棱两可，拒绝去猜
There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
永远会有一个完美的答案
Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
尽管那个答案没那么容易看出来
Now is better than never.
现在胜于从不
Although never is often better than *right* now.
但从不胜于"不假思索的瞎干"
If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
能简单解释清楚的方案才是好的想法
Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
